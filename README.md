> **WARNING**: This is a fork of [jakobwesthoff/phuml][1] which isn't actively maintained anymore.
I've volunteered [to become the new maintainer][2].
My plan is to publish this library in Packagist and add support for PHP 7.

# phUML

## What is this all about?

phUML is fully automatic [UML][7] class diagram generator written [PHP][8].
It creates an image representation of the OO structure based on the UML specification.

## How does it look like?

[![UML Diagram][9]][10]

The image shown here is the class diagram generated by phUML when run on its previous codebase.
This image is hardly readable, because it has been resized to fit in the layout of this page.
You can take a look at the complete image by clicking [here][10].

## Can I use this for my own projects?

phUML should be compatible with any object oriented code written in PHP 5.

The console application works with so called processors.
Processors may be used to create different output formats.
There's currently 3 types of processors:

* Processors to produce a digraph using [DOT language][14]
* Processors to produce `png` class diagrams
* Processors to produce statistics

To successfully create UML diagrams you will need the [graphviz][11] toolkit installed on your system.
You may then call the `neato` or `dot` executables, which are part of graphviz, to process the created file
manually or you may have `phUML` do this for you.

This is the command used to generate the example you can see above.

```
$ vendor/bin/phuml phuml:diagram -r -a -p dot tests/.code example.png
```

This is the command used to generate the statistics of a codebase.

```
$ vendor/bin/phuml phuml:statistics -r tests/.code stats.txt
```

If you want to generate a different output using either `neato` or `dot` use the `phuml:dot` command

```
$ vendor/bin/phuml phuml:dot -r -a tests/.code dot.gv
```

It will generate a file with the class diagram information in DOT format.
