# phUML

phUML is a fully automatic [UML][6] class diagram generator written [PHP][7].
It creates a class diagram from an OO codebase based on the UML specification.

## Installation

Use [Composer][14] to download and install phUML as well as its dependencies.

```
$ composer require phuml/phuml
```

## How does it look like?

[![UML Diagram][8]][9]

The image shown here is the class diagram generated by phUML when run on its [previous codebase][15].
This image is hardly readable, because it has been resized to fit in the layout of this page.
You can take a look at the complete image by clicking [here][9].

## Usage

phUML should be compatible with any object oriented code written in PHP 5.

The console application works with so called processors.
Processors may be used to create 3 different output formats.

* A digraph using [DOT language][13]
* A `png` class diagram
* A text file with statistics

To successfully create UML diagrams you will need to install the [graphviz][10] toolkit.
You may then use the `neato` or `dot` executables, to create class diagrams.

This is the command used to generate the example you can see above.

```
$ vendor/bin/phuml phuml:diagram -r -a -p dot tests/resources/.code example.png
```

This is the command used to generate the statistics of a codebase.

```
$ vendor/bin/phuml phuml:statistics -r tests/resources/.code stats.txt
```

If you want to generate a different output using either `neato` or `dot`, use the `phuml:dot` command

```
$ vendor/bin/phuml phuml:dot -r -a tests/resources/.code dot.gv
```

It will generate a file with the class diagram information in DOT format.
